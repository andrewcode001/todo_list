# todo_list
A to-do list project that can categorize tasks with basic CRUD functionality. 
The list will allow the user to create a category to track. Within any category, there will be a nested array that stores tasks related to the category.
This project will implement local storage, data attributes, and manipulating the DOM using Javascript logic.
